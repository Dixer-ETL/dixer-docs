# Jobs group

Dixer provides a way to execute a workflow by group like a unique job and return the result for that workflow.

To do this, set the job with type `jobsgroup`.

This job type has one key called `exec_workflow` with the same logic to execute the workflow defined in [The key `exec_workflow`](../Key-exec-workflow.md).
